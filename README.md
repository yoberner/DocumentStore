# DocumentStore
Document Store Database (Data Structures Project):

• Developed an application that takes in text or pdf files and stores them in memory.

• Using PDF Box library, the application can return any text document as a pdf or vice versa.

• Programmed to keep a dictionary lookup which maps words/prefixes to all documents containing that word/prefix.

• User can define a limit of how many documents can be stored in memory, if the limit is reached the least used document is stored on the disk in JSON format.

• System tracks all actions chronologically, allowing for undo capability.

The project was done in 5 stages over the course of the semester, the final stage can be found in DocumentStore/stage5
